# Elixir distributed

## Goal

In this course we'll cover the distributed aspects of Elixir. We assume that you've completed the [elixir-basics](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-basics) course and [elixir-otp](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-otp) course. The topics are listed under [Topics](#topics), which will be a short summary of what is covered in this repository.

## Topics

- [X] Connecting nodes (manually & with libcluster)
- [X] Internode communication (through GenServer API)
- [X] global registry
- [X] distributed app that naively balances games over different nodes

## Roadmap / missing topics

- [ ] Kafka
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] Node takeover / failover?
- [ ] Horde?
- [ ] Riak?
- [ ] Redis?

## Note

At the moment of writing, this course is rather lacking in content and exercises. We're working on it!
