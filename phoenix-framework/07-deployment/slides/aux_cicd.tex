    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple developers pushing small, frequent changes to a shared repository
        \item Often comes with Continuous Deployment
        \item CircleCI build has generally multiple steps:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item dependencies
            \item testing
            \item deployment
        \end{itemize}

    feel free to simplify this to following branches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item dev
        \item prod
    \end{itemize}
    You can configure your CI/CD to do specific task on specific branches (e.g. only deploy prod branch)
