# Associations

While I'd love to create a whole guide for this, it's already done quite nicely on [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/ecto/associations/). Personally I found [this link](https://ezcook.de/2018/05/15/cast-assoc/) clarifying as well.

To test your skills, you can try to add a second entity, called Jobs. Make up some fields and configure that many to many association. Try to use [nested resources](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/routing.html#nested-resources) in your router.
